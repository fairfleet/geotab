/** The IncludeGroups enum provides a method of querying for entities relative to the entity's position in the hierarchy of {@link Group}(s). Some entity types (such as {@link Zone}(s)) have implications to entities in their child groups. For example; on a map, it may be useful to include {@link Zone}(s) that are above the user's data scope groups. These {@link Zone}(s) will also apply to vehicles that are at or below the selected {@link Group}(s) of the {@link Zone}. */
